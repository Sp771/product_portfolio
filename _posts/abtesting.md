## Execution
When I joined the project, there was no dedicated reimbursement portal. The users reimbursement process was manually handled through NetSuite, creating inefficiencies and slow approval cycles. Members/employees faced delays in receiving reimbursements, which negatively impacted morale.

I took the initiative to design and build a brand-new reimbursement portal from scratch. With limited resources—a sole developer and no dedicated QA team—I led the effort to create a streamlined, automated system to manage expense submissions, approvals, and tracking. My role encompassed everything from product design to testing, as I personally handled QA to ensure the system functioned smoothly.

Despite the lack of a large team, I collaborated closely with cross-functional stakeholders to ensure the portal was user-friendly, efficient, and integrated seamlessly with existing systems. The result was a fully functional reimbursement portal that significantly reduced processing times, improved transparency, and minimized errors, ultimately enhancing the users experience.

## Challenges & Achievements

### Challenges
* **🚧 Seamless NetSuite Integration** Since the back-end was powered by NetSuite, I worked to ensure that the portal integrated smoothly with this system to securely house user financial information. This integration had to be efficient and accurate, ensuring a seamless flow of data between the portal and NetSuite.

* **🚧 Rapid Execution Under Pressure:** With only one developer and no dedicated QA resources, I took on the responsibility of testing the feature while balancing objectivity to avoid bias. The timeline was tight, as we had a demo scheduled for a potential prospect. The sales team had promised the feature, but it didn't exist yet, so we needed to deliver a working solution quickly to meet expectations.

* **🚧 Navigating Stakeholder Opinions:** With multiple stakeholders involved, managing differing opinions and aligning everyone on a common vision was crucial. I worked to balance feedback from all sides, ensuring that the solution met both business goals and user needs while maintaining a fast-paced development timeline.

### Achievements
* **🏅 Improved Reimbursement Speed:** The new portal reduced the reimbursement process from several weeks to just days, enabling employees to receive their reimbursements much faster. This not only boosted user/employee morale but also streamlined financial operations.

* **🏅 Driving Sales and Adoption:** Post-launch, the feature improved the overall product offering, contributing to a 15% increase in sales as it became a selling point for potential clients. The integration with NetSuite provided valuable financial visibility, driving confidence in both internal teams and customers.

* **🏅 Increased Transparency and Accountability:** With automated tracking and approval workflows, employees could now easily check the status of their reimbursements, and managers could review expenses with greater visibility. This led to a significant reduction in errors and fraud, ultimately improving trust in the system.
