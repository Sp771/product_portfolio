## Execution
When I joined the Event Catalog/Event Manager project, the primary objective was to create a seamless way for association members to view and purchase events through the member portal. The system needed to display upcoming and past events, and integrate with NetSuite to manage all event-related data, financials, and inventory. I led the design and development process from scratch, ensuring the product aligned with both user needs and business requirements.

I worked closely with a team of 7 developers across Eastern Europe, managing the feature development and ensuring smooth communication despite the time zone differences. Using Figma, I designed the user interface and collaborated with the team to bring the product vision to life. Throughout the process, I ran refinements, participated in client calls, and led user testing to ensure the design met client expectations and addressed any issues early on.

Despite challenges such as client requests for last-minute changes and slow speeds in the portal, we successfully delivered a user-friendly and efficient system. I continuously iterated on feedback from demos and stakeholder calls to enhance the final product. The end result provided members with a smooth and intuitive event purchasing experience while maintaining robust back-end integrations.

## Challenges & Achievements

### Challenges
* **🚧 Complex Cart Design:** Designing a cart that allowed members to add guests, provide permissions for group registrations, and display hotel and preference selections presented a challenge. I worked closely with stakeholders to ensure that these requirements were integrated into the feature smoothly.

* **🚧 Client Communication Issues:** The client’s internal communication struggles threatened to delay the project. This resulted in additional calls to demonstrate the feature and incorporating last-minute requests, requiring flexibility and swift execution.

* **🚧 NetSuite Integration:** Integrating the feature with NetSuite to securely house event records, financial data, and inventory posed technical challenges that I addressed through careful planning and collaboration with the development team.

### Achievements
* **🏅 Enhanced Member Experience:** Delivered a seamless and user-friendly event management experience that enabled members to easily browse, purchase, and manage event registrations, significantly improving user satisfaction.

* **🏅 Product Cart (Unexpected Success):** The code used for the event catalog was leveraged to create a product cart for members to purchase memberships and physical items, such as books, contributing to broader use of the feature across the platform.

* **🏅 Improved System Efficiency:** Addressed slow purchasing speeds within the portal, optimizing the system to ensure faster and smoother transactions for users, improving overall portal performance.
